<h3>BACKGROUND OF THE QOTA PROTEST:</h3>
<img class="qota" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.hFsvI1Fg-5f-r4Uj0XKL9wHaEK?w=332&h=187&c=7&r=0&o=5&pid=1.7"height=400;width=900/>

On July 15, 2024, students at Dhaka University peacefully protested for reforms in the government job quota allocation system. They demanded changes to the existing quota system, which had become a contentious issue due to rising unemployment.

</strong></p>

<h3>Violence Erupts:</h3>
<img class="erupts" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.6fe9064cc4d4718a5ea0c790145ee0bd?rik=CDm5fUyq4P%2f0Ew&pid=ImgRaw&r=0"height=400;width=900/>
<p><strong>

The protests turned violent when individuals, believed to be affiliated with the ruling Awami League’s student wing (Bangladesh Chatra League), attacked the student protesters. Armed with rods, sticks, and even revolvers, they assaulted the demonstrators.

</strong></p>

<h3>Tragic Death:</h3>

<p><strong>

Abu Sayed, a student at Begum Rokeya University, became a symbol of the violence. In a moment of defiance, he faced the police, who shot him directly in the chest. Sayed’s death sparked outrage and intensified the protests.

</strong></p>

<h3>Mounting Toll:</h3>

<p><strong>

By July 18, the death toll reached 32, with the highest number of deaths (75) reported on July 19. Journalists and bystanders were also targeted during the crackdown. The government imposed a communication blackout, leaving the world guessing about the situation.

<h3>Deployment of Forces:</h3>
